FEDERAL CLIMATE COMPLEX DATA DOCUMENTATION FOR INTEGRATED SURFACE DATA (ISD)

page 5
1) For data files obtained via FTP or from NCEI’s archive, the filename convention uses the USAF identifier and the WBAN identifier
in the filename—eg, 723150-03812-year (such as 2006).
2) As additional data sources are integrated into ISD, the 2 station number fields will be used as an 11-digit ID field, with the first 2
digits representing the WMO block number (if applicable).
