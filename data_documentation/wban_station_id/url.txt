Miscellaneous Station Reports
WBAN, Weather-Bureau-Army-Navy

WBAN numbers were the first major attempt at a coordinated station numbering scheme among several weather reporting authorities. Original participants in the WBAN number plans were the United States Weather Bureau, Air Force, Navy, and Army, and the Canadian Department of Transportation. Selected German and Korean stations in close cooperation with the US Weather Services are also included. This list is updated monthly.
